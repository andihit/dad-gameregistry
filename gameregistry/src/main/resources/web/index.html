    <title>GameRegistry server - Distributed Systems (us.es) 2014/15</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>GameRegistry server</h1>
<p>
    Welcome to the <b>GameRegistry</b> server page! If you are seeing this
    it means the GameRegistry server is up and running.
</p>
<h2>What are we</h2>
<p>
    The GameRegistry server is part of a distributed system built for a course called
    <a href="http://www.us.es/esl/estudios/grados/plan_204/asignatura_2040023">Diseño de Aplicaciones Distribuidas</a>
    from the <a href="https://www.informatica.us.es/">ETSII</a> of Seville's University. It is an information
    system designed to store game sessions inside the game platform implemented through the course.
</p>
<p>
    More specifically the server stores JSon objects representing Game Sessions into a
    <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB server</a> and exposes them, all through a
    <a href="/doc/">RESTful API</a>.
</p>
<p>
    GameRegistry is written in Groovy, uses <a href="http://vertx.io/">Vert.x</a> as the base framework and
    <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a> as a build system.
</p>


<h2>Who are we</h2>
<p>
    GameRegistry is developed by the two members of Group 18 (8:30 every tuesday over the second semester) of the
    course:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/galvesband">Rafael Gálvez-Cañero</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/andihit">Andreas Gerstmayr</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    To contact us you can follow the
    <a href="https://github.com/andihit/dad-gameregistry">project's github page</a> and create
    an <i>issue</i>.
</p>
<h2>The code and the repository</h2>
<p>
    You can download or browse the code from the
    <a href="https://github.com/andihit/dad-gameregistry">project's github page</a>.
</p>
<h2>The REST API and the documentation of the project</h2>
<p>
    Our server implements a simple REST API to talk to get or return the game sessions
    the other subsystems send or require from us. You can see the
    <a href="/doc/">Swagger specification of the GameRegistry API</a> or
    look into out
    <a href="https://github.com/andihit/dad-gameregistry/blob/master/memoria/MemoriaGrupo18_main.pdf">Memoir (PDF)</a>.
</p>
<h2>Client classes for Vert.x platforms</h2>
<p>
    In our project code repository we have an example Maven project that makes use of our
    GameRegistryClient, composed of a few very simple classes that make it easy to access our
    server from a Vert.x project. You can browse the code
    <a href="https://github.com/andihit/dad-gameregistry/tree/master/gameregistry-client-example">here</a>.
